Glassfish3 Deployment:
----------------------------------
./GFserver3 status 		- To check the status of the server whether it is up/down
./GFserver3 stop --all	- To stop the server
./GFserver3 start --all	- To Start server
./GFserver3 restore		- To restore the nodes and clusters (Creates folders nodes and cluster-domain) - To be done before starting the server.
./GFserver3 configure	- To be done without stopping the server.(Need to restart server after doing this step)
kill -9 processID		- Kills the process forcefully
rm -r <file1> <file2>	- To remove file

Galssfish 2 Deployment:
----------------------------------
./GFserver status		- To check status of server
./GFserver stopall		- Stop server
rm -rf <file1> <file2>	- To remove file
tar xvf <tarballname>	- Extract tar file
./GFserver recreate		- Creates clusterdomain and nodeagents
./GFserver reconfigure	- Configure the application
./GFserver startall		- Start server
kill -9 <processId>		- To kill the process

Glassfish4 Deployment:
----------------------------------
To deploy the application, following procedure need to be used:
sample - ./GFserver4 create-tar -f tmp/3830_D_20170802_1835.tar
Note:- Creating tar ball
1. Stop the Payara / GlassFish 4 instance(s) and DAS by executing the following
command on each hosting server of the cluster (lpapp425vm/lpapp426vm/lpapp427vm/lpapp428vm):
	./GFserver4 stop --all
2. Clean currently existig config directory on the hosting server where DAS is running:
	./GFserver4 remove-config
3. Clean the content of the directories project-local and/or project-synced:
	./GFserver4 remove-project-local
	./GFserver4 remove-project-synced
Note: it will remove the files insede the folders  project-local & project-synced
4. Extracts the “tarball” rmt-dist-app-[x.x.x]-prod.tar:
	./GFserver4 extract-tar -f 3830_D_20170802_1835.tar
5. Remove “old” clusterDomain and nodes directories:
	./GFserver4 remove-domain
Note: it will delete cluster domain folder and files in nodes folder.
6. Recreate the clusterDomain directory and its contents.
	./GFserver4 restore
Note: Also it will stop the application servers.
7. Start the application server instances by executing the following command on
each hosting server of the cluster (lpapp425vm/lpapp426vm/lpapp427vm/lpapp428vm)
	./GFserver4 start --all
8. Run the postchange script only on the hosting server where DAS is running
	./GFserver4 exec -f config/hooks/postchange
Note:
